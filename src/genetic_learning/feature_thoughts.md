# DNA

Needs:

state representation


Wants?

mutation function?
crossover function?
  


# Population

Needs:

- create population(each have DNA representation)




# Evolution

Needs:

- Population

- evaluate population (best performers)

- Evolve function 
    - get top X%
    - crossover
    - mutate (% chance to mutate)



# How do we make a simple, stupid evolution?
1) evaluate on strictly number of passengers getting 
   to their destination

2) Population: Multiple simulations

3) DNA representation of a single member of the population 
    - single member is a single simulation 
    - number of buses
    - buses' DNA
        - stops serviced



Question: How do we make DNA generic? JSONified? Hmm.
